SuperVIO UI
===========
This repository provides for the Django based SuperVIO UI. It is based
on the code originally targeted at VSOM, but has been adapted for use
in SuperVIO.

# Getting Started
If you intend to use this code outside the context of SuperVIO, you
can read the INSTALL document for some historically useful information.

# The Right Way
A much easier way to wprk with this code is via the SuperVIO Ansible
Playbooks project (and related modules and roles). That is
within the ansible-playbooks-supervio project, which has a complete
README.md file for setting up SuperVIO for both use and development.
